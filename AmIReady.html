<ul class="questions">
  <li>Why do you want a pet?
    <ul>
    <li>It's amazing how many people fail to ask themselves this simple question before they get pets. 
	    Adopting a pet just because it's "the thing to do" or because the kids have been pining for a puppy
	    usually ends up being a big mistake. Don't forget that pets may be with you 10, 15, even 20 years.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do you have time for a pet? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Dogs, cats, and other animal companions cannot be ignored just because you're tired or busy.
	    They require food, water, exercise, care, and companionship every day of every year.
	    Many animals in the shelter are there because their owners didn't realize how much time it took to care for them.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Can you afford a pet? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The costs of pet ownership can be quite high. Licenses, training classes, 
	    veterinary care, grooming, toys, food, kitty litter, and other expenses add up quickly.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Are you prepared to deal with special problems that a pet can cause?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Flea infestations, scratched-up furniture, accidents from animals that aren't yet house trained,
	    and unexpected medical emergencies are unfortunate but common aspects of pet ownership.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Are you willing to train your animal companion? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Lack of training is one of the most common reasons that adopters return pets to sheltersâ€”are 
	    you willing to solve behavior problems? Basic training helps dogs and their owners communicate better, 
	    strengthening the relationship overall. And taking the time to understand why your cat does what she does,
	    especially when it involves her litter box and scratching habits, will help you avoid potential problems.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Can you have a pet where you live? </li>
  <ul>
    <li> Many rental communities don't allow pets, and most of the rest have restrictions. 
	    Make sure you know what they are before you bring a companion animal home.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Is it a good time for you to adopt a pet? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have kids under 6 years old, for instance, you might consider waiting a few years
	    before you adopt a companion. Pet ownership requires children who are mature enough to be responsible.
	    If you're a student, in the military, or travel frequently as part of your work, 
	    waiting until you settle down is wise.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Are your living arrangements suitable for the animal you have in mind? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Animal size is not the only variable to think about here. For example, 
	    some small dogs such as terriers are very active - they require a great deal of exercise to be calm, 
	    and they often bark at any noise. On the other hand, some big dogs are laid back and quite content
	    to lie on a couch all day. Before adopting a pet, do some research. That way,
	    you'll ensure you choose an animal that will fit into your lifestyle and your living arrangements.</li>
    </ul>
 <li>Will you be a responsible pet owner? </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Having your pet spayed or neutered, obeying community leash and licensing laws, 
	    and keeping identification tags on your pets are all part of being a responsible owner. 
	    Of course, giving your pet love, companionship, exercise, a healthy diet, and regular 
	    veterinary care are other essentials.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<p> Sure, it's a long list of questions. But taking a quick stroll through an animal
	shelter will help you understand why answering them before you adopt is so important. 
	Many of the Midlands homeless pets are puppies and kittens, victims of irresponsible people 
	who allowed their pets to breed. But there are at least as many dogs and cats at the shelter
	who are more than a year old-animals who were obtained by people who didn't think through the 
	responsibilities of pet ownership before they got the animal. Please, don't make the same mistake.
	Think before you adopt.</p>
