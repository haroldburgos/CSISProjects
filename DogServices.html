Review: After my dog's (Casey) hip was dislocated from jumping off a tall table in the back porch I landed into the hands <br>
of Strothertowne Pet Hospital. Dr. Jones and his staff took can of Casey making sure she had what she needed to recover. The amount of <br>
help and support. Casey was able to have her surgury and is now alive up and running thanks to Strothertowne Pet Hospital.<br>

Review: I personally always take Casey to Belton's PetSmart location because first it is a very short commute from my home.<br>
secondly, since I bring casey in on daily basis they have created a friend bond with her and even recognize her once we walk in.<br>
Last but not least I really love this establishment because when I go pick up my baby, I recieve a report about her behavior during <br>
the treatments. I know how good she behaved and personal notes on what they recommend for an upcoming appointment.<br>
